# templateQueuesProject
In the book (page 1106), there is code for a dynamic queue of integers. Convert that to a template version, so the queue can work with integers, doubles, strings, and so on. Demonstrate this by creating a queue for doubles and another queue for strings, pushing data into each queue, and then removing data from the queue and displaying it. Hard code the input for both queues; you don't need to ask for user input. Use while loops to get the data from each queue for display.

The result should look like this:

![ch18-queue.PNG](https://github.com/bell-kevin/templateQueuesProject/blob/main/template.PNG)

Use this data:

       technology phrase = technology is everywhere
       
       programming phrase = programming is an exciting career
       
       computers phrase = computers run the universe

Take a screenshot of the results which must match the example.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
