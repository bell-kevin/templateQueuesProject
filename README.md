# templateQueuesProject
In the book (page 1106), there is code for a dynamic queue of integers. Convert that to a template version, so the queue can work with integers, doubles, strings, and so on. Demonstrate this by creating a queue for doubles and another queue for strings, pushing data into each queue, and then removing data from the queue and displaying it. Hard code the input for both queues; you don't need to ask for user input. Use while loops to get the data from each queue for display.

The result should look like this:

Use this data:
       technology phrase = technology is everywhere
       
       programming phrase = programming is an exciting career
       
       computers phrase = computers run the universe

Take a screenshot of the results which must match the example.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.
